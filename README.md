# Telegram-bot-COVID-19-info

Greetings, it is my first project with <strong>JavaScript</strong> — more precisely, on <strong>Node.JS</strong>.

Why Node.JS, if I have not some projects at the pure JavaScript?

I don't know, really...
I've seen one video, which was about Telegram's bot on Node.JS
And after this, I wanted to do my own bot :D
That's why I decided to create this project...
Maybe It will be so bad with too many mistakes.
But It will be really excellent experience for me.
It will be really not bad for the first JS project, yeah?

If you will see any mistakes or defects — write to me or make a pull request.
Because the most important thing for me — learn how to code.

Well, welcome, my friend!

<h2>What can the bot do?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you will write a country name, for example: <strong>"Hungary"</strong> - it will respond with statistics on cases of illness, death, and recovery in the country of your choice;</li>
  <li>You can write <strong>"Deaths"</strong> || <strong>"deaths"</strong> - it will respond with statistics about deaths around the world;</li>
  <li>If you ask <strong>"/help"</strong> - he answered how should you ask a question and what he will answer.</li>
</ul>
