# Telegram-bot-COVID-19-info

Greetings, it is my first project with JavaScript — more precisely, on Node.JS.

Why Node.JS, if I have not some projects at the ordinary JavaScript?

I don't know, really...
I've seen one video, which was about Telegram's bot on Node.JS
And after this, I wanted to do my own bot :D
That's why I decided to create this project...
Maybe It will be so bad with too many mistakes.
But It will be really excellent experience for me.
It will be really not bad for the first JS project, yeah?

If you will see any mistakes or defects — write to me or make a pull request.
Because the most important thing for me — learn how to code.

Well, welcome, my friend!
